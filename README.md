## Project Overview
---
Get Fed is an online cookbook where visitors to the site can browse a selection of recipes added by admin and other users. A visitor will have the choice to simply browse or create their own profile in order to add their own recipes to the site and it's database. Each user will also have the choice to delete their profiles and personal recipes. 

!!! Document your decisions - and the reasons for  these decisions - at each stage of the 5 planes,  
and include this information in  the UX section of your README file. !!!

!!! Speaking of user stories, these are a particularly  important part of your project to define in detail  
before you get started with your coding. They  clearly define the needs and wants of your target  
audience, !!!
